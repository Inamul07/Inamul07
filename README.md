Hey! Thank you for your interest in learning more about me. My name is Mohammed Inamul Hassan, and I'm a third-year B.Tech/ Information Technology undergraduate at Sri Sairam Engineering College. I enjoy picking up new skills and technology. I strive to improve as a programmer and a problem solver. Android app development and UI/UX design are two of my favourite things to do. Apart from my professional life, I enjoy cricket and football, as well as a popular pastime these days: gaming.
